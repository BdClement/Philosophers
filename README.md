# Philosophers 🧐 📖 

The Philosophers project introduces fundamental concepts in concurrent programming, such as:

- Thread creation and management
- Synchronization using mutexes
- Avoiding deadlocks and race conditions

I implemented it using tools like pthread_create, pthread_mutex, and usleep, ensuring proper resource sharing among threads.  
This project could be highly beneficial for future multi-threaded programs
